```markdown
# Python Sample Repository

A small collection of Python examples designed for educational use.  
The goal of this project is to help new developers understand how Python code is structured, tested, and executed.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- Basic scripts: loops, conditionals, and functions
- File operations and error handling
- Small algorithmic examples
- Demonstrations of modules like `os`, `json`, and `datetime`

## How to Use
You can open the files in any text editor or IDE (such as VS Code or PyCharm) and run them directly.  
Each file is independent, so you can experiment with changes without affecting others.

## Learning Tips
- Try modifying variables and observing the output.
- Add print statements to see how data flows through the program.
- Review the comments in each file for explanations.

## Contribution
If you want to contribute new examples or corrections, please open a pull request.
