## Key Features

The AI Gateway offers a robust set of capabilities to ensure secure and efficient AI integration:

- **AI Vendor Key Configuration:**  Securely authenticate with AI providers by configuring API keys obtained from each vendor.

- **Token-Based Rate Limiting:** Protect backend services and manage costs by applying rate limits based on token usage rather than just request counts.
  
- **AI API Observability (Coming Soon):** Gain insights into AI API performance and usage with built-in analytics and monitoring.

With these features, organizations can integrate, monitor, and scale AI services efficiently, unlocking the full potential of AI-driven applications.

### Token-Based Rate Limiting

AI services typically charge based on tokens rather than requests, making cost control critical. Choreo AI Gateway enables token-based rate limiting at the API level to:

- Define quotas based on LLM token consumption.
- Prevent unexpected costs by controlling overuse.
- Enforce fair usage policies across AI-powered APIs.
